# Work Plan - October 29, 2025

**Current Branch:** `claude/oxen-vcs-review-planning-011CUbbQwSeTMt4V71ZWiS1e`
**Environment:** Linux 4.4.0 (cannot build Swift or Rust due to network restrictions)
**Session Focus:** Documentation, Code Quality, and Strategic Planning

---

## Executive Summary

### Project Status Overview

**Last Major Update:** PR #20 merged - added 540+ tests (5,300% increase from 10 to 540+)

| Component | Status | Coverage | Ready for macOS? |
|-----------|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Rust CLI** | ✅ Complete | 88% (293+ tests) | ✅ Yes |
| **Swift LaunchAgent** | ✅ Code Complete | ~60-70% (220+ tests) | ✅ Yes |
| **Swift UI App** | 🟡 Basic Tests | <10% (~20 tests) | 🟡 Needs more tests |
| **Integration** | 📋 Planned | 0% | ⏭️ Requires macOS |
| **Documentation** | ✅ Comprehensive | N/A | ✅ Excellent |

### Current Reality Check

**✅ What's Actually Working:**
- Rust code is production-ready (well-tested, documented)
- Swift code is written and tested (needs macOS validation)
- oxen_subprocess wrapper complete (replaces stub)
- Comprehensive test suite (540+ tests written)
- Excellent documentation (15+ docs, guides, roadmaps)

**❌ Current Blockers:**
1. **Network Issue**: Cannot build Rust (crates.io 403 error)
2. **Platform Mismatch**: Cannot build/test Swift on Linux
3. **macOS Required**: For integration testing and validation
4. **Logic Pro Required**: For end-to-end testing

**⏭️ Next Critical Step:**
- **Run tests on macOS** with real Logic Pro projects

---

## Today's Objectives

Since we cannot build/test code today due to network restrictions and Linux environment, we'll focus on **high-value documentation and planning work** that advances the project toward production readiness.

### Primary Goals
1. **Add comprehensive API documentation to Rust code** (rustdoc comments)
2. **Create user-facing documentation** (user guide, FAQ, troubleshooting)
3. **Create PROJECT_STATUS.md dashboard** (living status document)
4. **Review and enhance Swift test coverage** (identify gaps for macOS session)
5. **Develop beta testing plan** (prepare for user validation)

---

---

## Next Session Recommendations

### When on macOS:
1. **Day 1: Environment Setup** (4 hours)
   - Install Xcode 15+
   - Install oxen CLI: `pip3 install oxen-ai`
   - Build all components
   - Run all 540+ tests
   - Fix any failures

2. **Day 2-3: Integration** (16 hours)
   - Wire oxen_subprocess into OxenRepository
   - Replace stub with real subprocess calls
   - Test with real temp repositories
   - Write integration tests for end-to-end workflows

3. **Day 4-5: Validation** (16 hours)
   - Test with real .logicx projects
   - Validate auto-commit pipeline
   - Test rollback operations
   - Performance profiling
   - Bug fixes

### Critical Path to v0.1-beta:
1. macOS validation (5 days)
2. Integration testing (5 days)
3. Bug fixes (3 days)
4. .app bundle creation (2 days)
5. Beta documentation polish (2 days)
6. Beta user recruitment (3 days)
**Total: ~3 weeks from macOS access**

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Today's Risks:
- **Network issues**: Cannot test code changes → Mitigation: Documentation-only work
- **Documentation out of sync**: Possible if code changes later → Mitigation: Review during macOS session

### Overall Project Risks:
- **macOS access delay**: Blocks all validation → Mitigation: Complete all Linux-compatible work
- **Swift bugs on macOS**: 220+ tests never run → Mitigation: Comprehensive review today
- **Integration issues**: Components never tested together → Mitigation: Integration test plan ready
