A native macOS version control system for creative applications, leveraging Oxen.ai for efficient large binary file management.

## Supported Applications

- **Logic Pro** (.logicx) - Audio production with BPM, sample rate, key signature metadata
- **SketchUp** (.skp) - 3D modeling with units, layers, components, groups metadata
- **Blender** (.blend) - 3D modeling and animation support

## Overview

Professional creative projects contain massive binary assets that overwhelm traditional version control systems like Git. Auxin provides:

- **Block-level deduplication** for efficient storage of large audio files
- **Automatic background tracking** via FSEvents monitoring
- **Collision avoidance** through exclusive file locking
- **Power-safe commits** that trigger before system sleep
- **Non-destructive rollback** to any previous project state

## Recent Updates

### 🎨 3D Modeling Support (November 18, 2025)

Expanded support for 3D modeling applications:
- **SketchUp** (.skp) - Full support with metadata tracking (units, layers, components, groups)
- **Blender** (.blend) - Project detection and ignore patterns
- **Auto-detection** - Project type automatically detected from file extension
- **Unified CLI** - Same commands work across all supported applications

### ✨ SwiftUI Migration (October 29, 2025)

Migrated Auxin.app from AppKit to SwiftUI for improved reliability:
- **Migrated**: Complete UI rewrite using SwiftUI instead of AppKit

## Architecture

### Three-Component System

1. **Auxin-App** (Swift/SwiftUI) - Native macOS UI application with modern declarative interface
2. **Auxin-LaunchAgent** (Swift/FSEvents) - Persistent background daemon for file monitoring and draft tracking
3. **Auxin-CLI-Wrapper** (Rust/liboxen) - Optimized command executor for Oxen operations

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0+
- Oxen.ai CLI
- Xcode 15+
- Rust toolchain (for CLI wrapper)
- Application software as needed (Logic Pro, SketchUp, Blender)

## Installation

### Automated Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/auxin.git
cd auxin

# Run the automated installer
./install.sh
```

The installer will build all components, install binaries, configure the daemon service, and install the GUI app to `/Applications/Auxin.app`.

See [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.

### Manual Installation

See [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md) for step-by-step manual installation instructions.

## Quick Start

### Option A: GUI Application (Point and Click)

After installation, launch the double-clickable app:

1. Open Finder → Applications → Auxin
2. Click "Add Project..." to initialize a Logic Pro project
3. The app will monitor changes and create automatic draft commits
4. Create milestone commits with rich metadata (BPM, sample rate, tags)
5. Browse history and rollback to any previous version

### Option B: Command Line (Fast and Powerful) ✨ NEW!

**Enhanced with beautiful visual feedback and progress indicators:**

```bash
# Initialize projects (auto-detects type from extension)
auxin init ~/Music/YourProject.logicx        # Logic Pro
auxin init ~/Models/Building.skp              # SketchUp
auxin init ~/Projects/Scene.blend             # Blender

# Or explicitly specify type
auxin init --type logicpro ~/Music/Project.logicx
auxin init --type sketchup ~/Models/Model.skp
auxin init --type blender ~/Projects/Scene.blend

# Check what changed
auxin status
# Shows: staged, modified, and untracked files with color coding

# Stage and commit with application-specific metadata
auxin add --all

# Logic Pro commit
auxin commit -m "Vocal tracking done" --bpm 120 --tags "vocals"

# SketchUp commit
auxin commit -m "Added roof structure" --units Feet --layers 15 --components 200

# View history with filtering
auxin log --limit 10
# Shows: commits with metadata

# Restore to previous version
auxin restore abc123f
```

### Option C: Advanced CLI Features ✨ NEW!

**Compare commits semantically:**
```bash
# Compare two commits (shows BPM, key, sample rate changes)
auxin compare abc123f def456g
# Shows colored diff of metadata changes

# Compare in different formats
auxin compare abc123f def456g --format json
auxin compare abc123f def456g --format compact
```

**Search with natural language:**
```bash
# Find all commits with specific criteria
auxin search "bpm:120-140 key:minor tag:mixing"
auxin search "bpm:>128 tag:vocals,final"

# Get ranked results
auxin search "bpm:120-140 key:minor" --ranked
```

**Automate workflows with hooks:**
```bash
# Initialize hooks directory
auxin hooks init

# Install built-in hooks
auxin hooks install validate-metadata --type pre-commit
auxin hooks install backup --type post-commit

# List installed hooks
auxin hooks list
```

**Interactive console mode:**
```bash
# Launch full-screen TUI
auxin console

# Keyboard shortcuts:
# i - Create commit (with metadata fields)
# l - Browse commit history
# d - Compare commits side-by-side
# s - Search commits
# k - Manage hooks
# r - Refresh status
# ? - Help
```

**See:** [CLI Examples](docs/CLI_EXAMPLES.md) for real production scenarios and team workflows.

**Which should you use?** Both work equally well! Choose based on preference:
- **New to version control?** Start with GUI
- **Comfortable with Terminal?** CLI is faster
- **Working remotely?** CLI works over SSH

See [User Guide for Musicians](docs/FOR_MUSICIANS.md) for detailed usage instructions.

## Testing

We maintain comprehensive test coverage across all components:

```bash
# Run all Rust tests
cd Auxin-CLI-Wrapper && cargo test

# Run all Swift tests
cd Auxin-LaunchAgent && swift test
cd Auxin-App && swift test
```

**Documentation**:
- [Testing Strategy](docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md) - Comprehensive testing approach
- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#testing) for detailed testing guidelines

**Coverage Goals**: 70-80% overall, with 90%+ coverage for critical paths (locks, commits, power management)

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/auxin.git
cd auxin

# Install dependencies
pip install oxen-ai  # Optional

# Run automated installation
./install.sh
```

For manual build instructions, see [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md).

- [x] **Phase 2: Service Architecture & Resilience** - ✅ COMPLETE
  - LaunchAgent integration with automatic startup
  - Power management integration (sleep/shutdown commits)
  - Auto-commit workflow with draft branches
  - XPC communication for UI integration
  - Multi-project monitoring

## Key Features

### Automatic Draft Tracking
Background daemon monitors Logic Pro project folder and automatically commits working states to a local draft branch after detecting file inactivity.

### Milestone Commits
User-triggered commits that:
- Clean up volatile files (bounces, freeze files)
- Tag significant production milestones
- Include metadata (BPM, sample rate, key signature)
- Sync to remote Oxen repository

### Power-Safe Operation
System power observers force immediate draft commits before sleep/shutdown to prevent data loss.

### Collaboration Protocol
- Exclusive file locking prevents binary merge conflicts
- FCP XML export/import for manual track reconciliation
- Remote repository sync via Oxen Hub
