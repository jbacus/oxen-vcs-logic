## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

```bash
# Check macOS version (must be 14.0+)
sw_vers

# Expected output:
# ProductName:    macOS
# ProductVersion: 14.x.x or higher
```

### Install Xcode Command Line Tools

```bash
xcode-select --install

# Verify installation
xcode-select -p
# Should output: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

### Install Oxen CLI

```bash
# Option 1: via pip (recommended)
pip3 install oxen-ai

# Option 2: via cargo
# cargo install oxen

# Verify installation
oxen --version
# Should output version number
```

### Build LaunchAgent Daemon

The app requires the OxVCS-LaunchAgent to be running for full functionality.

```bash
cd ../OxVCS-LaunchAgent
swift build -c release

# Install the daemon
./install_daemon.sh

# Verify daemon is running
launchctl list | grep com.oxenvcs
```

---

## Quick Start

### Automated Build (Recommended)

```bash
cd /path/to/oxen-vcs-logic

# Run the complete installation script
./install.sh

# This will:
# 1. Build Rust CLI wrapper
# 2. Build LaunchAgent daemon
# 3. Build GUI app
# 4. Install everything to system locations
# 5. Launch the app
```

### Manual Build (Development)

```bash
cd OxVCS-App

# Build debug version
swift build

# Build release version
swift build -c release

# Run directly
.build/debug/OxVCS
```

---

## Detailed Build Instructions

### Step 1: Clean Build

```bash
cd OxVCS-App

# Remove any previous build artifacts
rm -rf .build

# Clean Swift package cache (if needed)
swift package clean
```

### Step 2: Resolve Dependencies

```bash
# Resolve Swift package dependencies
swift package resolve

# This should complete quickly as we have no external dependencies
```

### Step 3: Build

```bash
# Debug build (faster, includes debug symbols)
swift build

# Release build (optimized, recommended for testing)
swift build -c release

# Verbose output (for debugging build issues)
swift build -c release -v
```

### Step 4: Verify Build

```bash
# Check that binary was created
ls -lh .build/release/OxVCS

# Expected output:
# -rwxr-xr-x  1 user  staff   XXX KB  Date  OxVCS
```

---

## Running the App

### From Command Line

```bash
# Run debug build
.build/debug/OxVCS

# Run release build
.build/release/OxVCS
```

### From Xcode

```bash
# Open package in Xcode
open Package.swift

# Or use:
xed .

# In Xcode:
# 1. Select "OxVCS" scheme (top left)
# 2. Press âŒ˜R to build and run
# 3. Check console for any errors
```

### As App Bundle

```bash
# Create app bundle using install script
cd ..
./install.sh

# Launch installed app
open /Applications/OxVCS.app

# Or from Finder: Applications â†’ OxVCS
```

---

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-Testing Setup

```bash
# 1. Ensure daemon is running
launchctl list | grep com.oxenvcs
# Should show: com.oxenvcs.agent with a PID

# 2. Create a test Logic Pro project
# Open Logic Pro, create a new project, save as:
# ~/Music/Test-Project.logicx

# 3. Verify Oxen CLI works
oxen --version
oxen init --help
```

## Running Unit Tests

```bash
cd OxVCS-App

# Run all tests
swift test

# Run with verbose output
swift test -v

# Run specific test target
swift test --filter OxVCS-AppTests

# Generate code coverage (requires Xcode)
swift test --enable-code-coverage

# View coverage report
xcodebuild test -scheme OxVCS -enableCodeCoverage YES
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

**Issue:** "Command line tools are not installed"
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**Issue:** "Swift version X.X is not supported"
```bash
# Update Xcode to latest version
# Or check Package.swift swift-tools-version
```

**Issue:** "Build failed with unresolved symbols"
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf .build
swift package clean
swift build
```

### Runtime Failures

**Issue:** App crashes on launch
```bash
# Run with debug output
.build/debug/OxVCS

# Check Console.app for crash logs
# Filter by "OxVCS"
```

**Issue:** "Daemon: Not Running"
```bash
# Check daemon status
launchctl list | grep com.oxenvcs

# Manually start daemon
cd ../OxVCS-LaunchAgent
.build/release/OxVCS-LaunchAgent &

# Or install as service
./install_daemon.sh
```

**Issue:** "Failed to initialize project"
```bash
# Check Oxen CLI is installed
which oxen
oxen --version

# Check oxenvcs-cli is installed
which oxenvcs-cli
/usr/local/bin/oxenvcs-cli --version

# If missing, build CLI wrapper
cd ../OxVCS-CLI-Wrapper
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/oxenvcs-cli /usr/local/bin/
```

**Issue:** XPC connection failures
```bash
# Check daemon is running
ps aux | grep OxVCS-LaunchAgent

# Check XPC service name matches
# In code: "com.oxen.logic.daemon.xpc"
# Should match daemon's registered service name
```

### UI Issues

**Issue:** Window doesn't appear
```bash
# Check if window is off-screen
# Press âŒ˜M to minimize, then click dock icon
# Or delete preferences:
defaults delete com.oxen.logic.OxVCS
```

**Issue:** Toolbar icons missing
- Requires macOS 14.0+ for SF Symbols
- Update system or use text-only buttons

**Issue:** Status bar not updating
- Check daemon is running and responding
- Try manual refresh (âŒ˜R)

   # Submit for notarization
   xcrun notarytool submit /Applications/OxVCS.app --apple-id YOUR_EMAIL --password APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD --team-id YOUR_TEAM_ID
   ```

3. **Create DMG Installer**
   ```bash
   # Use create-dmg or similar tool
   create-dmg --volname "OxVCS Installer" --window-size 600 400 --icon OxVCS.app 200 200 --app-drop-link 400 200 OxVCS-Installer.dmg /Applications/OxVCS.app
