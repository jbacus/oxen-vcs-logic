# OxVCS Semantic Audio Diff - START HERE

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-30
**Current Status**: Phase 1 - 80% Complete, Ready for Reverse Engineering
**Your System**: macOS Darwin 25.0.0, Logic Pro 11.2.2 ✅

---

## What Is This Project?

OxVCS is a version control system for Logic Pro projects that will eventually understand *semantic changes* in your music productions. Instead of just tracking binary blobs, it will report things like:

> "Lead Synth: EQ boosted +3 dB at 8 kHz, Compressor threshold raised from -18 to -12 dB"

---

## Current Status: What's Done

### ✅ Completed Today (2025-10-30)

**Phase 1 Implementation** (~2,200 lines of Rust, ~2,400 lines of docs):

1. **Core Data Structures** - Complete type system for Logic Pro projects
2. **Diff Engine** - Full comparison algorithms with smart thresholds
3. **Report Generator** - Human-readable and JSON output
4. **CLI Integration** - `oxenvcs-cli metadata-diff` command
5. **Testing** - 54 passing tests, clean compilation
6. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides for users and developers
7. **Reverse Engineering Workspace** - Tools and scripts ready to use

**What Works Right Now**:
```bash
# CLI is functional (once parser is complete)
oxenvcs-cli metadata-diff ProjectA.logicx ProjectB.logicx
oxenvcs-cli metadata-diff ProjectA.logicx ProjectB.logicx --output json
```

**What Doesn't Work Yet**:
- Binary parser (needs reverse engineering - this is your next task)
- Parsing real Logic Pro projects (blocked by above)

---

## What You Need to Do Next

### Tomorrow: Start Reverse Engineering (Week 1)

**Goal**: Find the byte offsets for tempo, sample rate, key signature, and time signature in Logic Pro's binary format.

**Start Here**:
```bash
cd logic_reverse_engineering
cat README.md  # Quick start guide

# Then create your first test projects and run the scripts
```

**Estimated Time**:
- First discovery session: 1-2 hours
- Complete Week 1 goals: 8-10 hours over several days

## What Each Phase Accomplishes

### Phase 1: Metadata Layer (Current - 80% Complete)
**Goal**: Parse Logic Pro project metadata and generate diff reports

**What It Does**:
- Reads `.logicx` project files
- Extracts tempo, tracks, EQ, compressor, volume, pan
- Compares two versions
- Generates human-readable reports

**Status**: Core implementation done, needs binary reverse engineering

### Phase 2: Audio Analysis (Future - 6 months)
**Goal**: Analyze actual audio content

**What It Would Do**:
- Extract audio features (MFCC, Chroma, Spectral)
- Perceptual hashing for fast comparison
- Detect audio content changes

**Status**: Planned, not started

### Phase 3: Temporal Alignment (Future - 6 months)
**Goal**: Handle timing changes

**What It Would Do**:
- Dynamic Time Warping for tempo changes
- Segment-level diff
- Smart merge suggestions

**Status**: Planned, not started

### Phase 4: Semantic Translation (Future - 6 months)
**Goal**: Producer-friendly language

**What It Would Do**:
- "Muddy" instead of "low-mid buildup"
- "Harsh" instead of "5kHz peak"
- Causal reporting (why things changed)

**Status**: Planned, not started

### Phase 5: Visualization (Future - 6 months)
**Goal**: Interactive UI

**What It Would Do**:
- Spectrograms
- A/B comparison player
- Timeline annotations

**Status**: Planned, not started

## Decision Points

### Week 6 Go/No-Go (Critical)
**Question**: Is binary parsing feasible?

**Criteria**:
- ✅ GO: Can parse 80%+ of metadata reliably
- 🔄 PIVOT: Switch to FCP XML export approach
- ❌ NO-GO: Pause and re-evaluate approach

### Month 6 (After Phase 1 Complete)
**Question**: Should we continue to Phase 2?

**Evaluate**:
- User adoption
- Feature usefulness
- Technical feasibility
- Business value

### Getting Unstuck

**If you're not sure where to start tomorrow**:
1. Read: `logic_reverse_engineering/README.md`
2. Create your first test project (tempo_120.logicx)
3. Duplicate and modify (tempo_128.logicx)
4. Run the extraction and comparison scripts
5. Document what you find

**If you find an offset**:
1. Validate with 3-4 more test projects
2. Document in `logic_reverse_engineering/findings/[parameter].md`
3. Update `OxVCS-CLI-Wrapper/src/logic_parser/binary_parser.rs`
4. Write a test
5. Move to next parameter

**If you get stuck on reverse engineering**:
- Try different Logic Pro versions (older might be simpler)
- Focus on high-value parameters first (tempo, sample rate)
- Consider FCP XML export as backup plan
- Document what you tried

## Final Notes

### What Makes This Unique

No other DAW version control system has semantic diff capabilities. If you complete Phase 1, you'll have something that:

1. **Understands Logic Pro** at a deep level
2. **Explains changes** in producer-friendly language
3. **Enables collaboration** through intelligent comparison
4. **Solves real pain points** for music producers

### The Critical Path

```
Binary Reverse Engineering (Week 1-6)
           ↓
    Parser Implementation
           ↓
    Integration Testing
           ↓
     MVP COMPLETE
           ↓
  [Decision: Continue to Phase 2?]
           ↓
    Audio Analysis
           ↓
    Full Semantic Diff System
```

### Why This Matters

Music producers waste hours:
- Manually comparing project versions
- Trying to remember what they changed
- Debugging mix changes that made things worse
- Collaborating without clear change communication

OxVCS solves this with **intelligent, semantic version control**.
