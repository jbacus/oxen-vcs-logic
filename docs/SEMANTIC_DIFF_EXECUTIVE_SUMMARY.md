# Semantic Audio Diff: Executive Summary

**Document**: Implementation plan for semantic audio diff system
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: Design complete, awaiting decision

---

## What Is It?

An **intelligent audio analysis system** that understands what changed between versions of a Logic Pro project, not just that something changed.

### Current State (OxVCS MVP)
- ✅ Tracks files (binary blobs)
- ✅ Commits/rollback
- ❌ No understanding of changes
- ❌ Binary merge conflicts unsolvable

### With Semantic Diff
- ✅ "EQ increased +3 dB at 8 kHz on Lead Synth"
- ✅ "Vocals now sound muddy (low-mid buildup detected)"
- ✅ "Tempo changed from 120→128 BPM (warping detected)"
- ✅ Intelligent segment-based audio merging

---

## The Big Idea: Bifurcated Strategy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  METADATA LAYER                         │
│  Parse Logic Pro project files          │
│  → "What the producer DID"              │
│  → "Added EQ, changed synth patch"      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                  ↓ Correlate
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AUDIO LAYER                            │
│  Analyze WAV/AIFF files                 │
│  → "What the producer HEARD"            │
│  → "Harshness increased, timbre changed"│
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Insight**: By combining both layers, the system can say:
> "Harshness increased **because** you boosted the EQ at 5 kHz"

This is **causal reporting** - not just detecting changes, but explaining them.

## The Five Layers

### Layer 1: Metadata Parsing
**What**: Reverse-engineer Logic Pro's `.logicx` binary format
**Output**: "Track 5: EQ changed, Compressor threshold -18→-12 dB"
**Difficulty**: ⚠️ High (proprietary format, no official API)

### Layer 2: Feature Extraction
**What**: Extract perceptual audio features (MFCCs, Chroma, Spectral Contrast)
**Output**: Multi-dimensional feature vectors for comparison
**Difficulty**: ✅ Medium (established audio DSP)

### Layer 3: Temporal Alignment
**What**: Use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to align versions
**Why**: Handles tempo changes, time-stretching, non-linear edits
**Output**: Precise localization of where audio diverged
**Difficulty**: ⚠️ High (computationally expensive, requires optimization)

### Layer 4: Semantic Translation
**What**: Map acoustic features → producer language
**Output**: "Muddy", "Harsh", "Bright" instead of "MFCC delta 0.5"
**Difficulty**: ⚠️ Medium-High (requires ML, subjective mapping)

### Layer 5: Visualization
**What**: Interactive spectrograms, A/B comparison, timeline annotations
**Output**: Producer-friendly UI for understanding changes
**Difficulty**: ✅ Medium (standard UI work)

## Timeline & Phases

| Phase | Features | Duration | Complexity | Value |
|-------|----------|----------|------------|-------|
| **0: MVP** | Basic VCS (current) | 1 month | ✅ Low | Essential |
| **1: Metadata** | Parse Logic files | 3-6 months | ⚠️ High | High |
| **2: Features** | Audio hashing, MFCC | 6 months | ✅ Medium | Medium |
| **3: DTW** | Temporal alignment | 6 months | ⚠️ High | Critical |
| **4: Semantic** | Feature mapping, ML | 6 months | ⚠️ High | High |
| **5: UI** | Visualization | 6 months | ✅ Medium | Polish |

**Total**: 24-30 months (2-2.5 years) for full system

---

## Key Technologies

### Must Have
- **Rust**: Logic Pro parsing, CLI integration
- **Python**: Audio analysis (librosa, DTW)
- **Swift**: macOS UI

### Core Libraries
- `librosa` - Audio feature extraction
- `chromaprint` - Perceptual hashing
- `fastdtw` - Optimized temporal alignment
- `transformers` - Pre-trained ML models

### Research Required
- Logic Pro binary format (reverse engineering)
- Feature-to-semantic lexicon refinement
- ML model training data collection

---

## Risks & Challenges

### HIGH RISK
1. **Logic Pro Format** - Proprietary, undocumented, may change
2. **DTW Performance** - O(n²) complexity for large files
3. **Resource Requirements** - 3-5 person team, 2+ years

### MEDIUM RISK
1. **Semantic Mapping** - Subjective, producer preferences vary
2. **ML Training Data** - Expensive to create labeled datasets
3. **Adoption** - Complex system, learning curve

### MITIGATION
- Incremental rollout (phases)
- Focus on XML where possible (avoid binary)
- Transfer learning (leverage pre-trained models)
- Extensive user testing

---

## Business Case

### Why Build This?

**Differentiation**: No competitor has this capability
- Git: Can't merge audio
- Perforce: No semantic understanding
- Splice/Landr: Cloud-only, limited analysis

**Market**: $X billion DAW market, collaboration pain point
**Competitive Advantage**: 2-3 year technical lead

### Why NOT Build This?

**Complexity**: Research project, not just engineering
**Time**: 2+ years before full value realized
**Risk**: Logic Pro format changes could break system
**Alternative**: Ship MVP, gauge demand, then decide

---

## Recommendation

### Option A: Full Implementation
**Commit**: 2-3 year roadmap, 3-5 person team
**Outcome**: Industry-leading audio VCS with semantic diff
**Risk**: High investment, uncertain ROI

### Option B: Phased Approach (RECOMMENDED)
**Phase 0** (NOW): Ship MVP - basic VCS
**Phase 1** (6 months): Metadata diff prototype
**Decision Point**: Evaluate adoption, demand, feasibility
**Phase 2+**: Continue if validated

### Option C: Simplified Version
**Skip**: ML, complex DTW, full semantic system
**Keep**: Metadata diff, basic audio hashing
**Timeline**: 6-12 months
**Trade-off**: Less impressive, but faster to market

---

## Decision Needed

**Question**: Should we pursue semantic audio diff?

**If YES**:
- Allocate resources for Phase 1 (metadata parsing)
- Begin Logic Pro reverse engineering research
- Hire audio DSP engineer

**If NO**:
- Ship MVP (Phase 0) with basic VCS
- Document capability for future consideration
- Focus on core features (locks, remote sync)

**If MAYBE**:
- Ship MVP first
- Prototype Phase 1 in parallel (1 engineer, 3 months)
- Decide based on results and user feedback

---

## Key Metrics for Success

**Technical**:
- 90%+ accuracy on metadata change detection
- <10s processing time for 5-minute audio
- 80%+ user trust in merge suggestions

**Business**:
- 70%+ adoption rate (users enable semantic diff)
- 8+/10 satisfaction rating
- 50%+ time saved vs manual comparison

---

## Conclusion

The semantic audio diff system is **technically feasible but ambitious**. It represents a **multi-year research project** that could transform OxVCS into an industry-leading tool.

**Core Trade-off**: Time/complexity vs. competitive differentiation

**Recommendation**: **Phased approach**
1. Ship MVP (1 month)
2. Prototype metadata diff (3-6 months)
3. Evaluate and decide on full implementation

This balances risk (get to market quickly) with innovation (preserve option to build semantic system based on real-world validation).

**Next Steps**:
1. ✅ Review this plan
2. ⏳ Decide on approach (A/B/C)
3. ⏳ Allocate resources
4. ⏳ Begin Phase 0 or Phase 1
