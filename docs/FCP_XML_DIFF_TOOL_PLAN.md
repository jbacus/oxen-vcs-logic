# Automated FCP XML Diff Tool - Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the design and implementation plan for an **Automated FCP XML Diff Tool** to address the binary merge problem in Logic Pro version control workflows. The tool will provide semantic-aware comparison of Final Cut Pro XML exports, dramatically improving the merge reconciliation process.

**Status**: Planning Phase
**Target Start**: Q1 2025
**Estimated Completion**: Q2 2025

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

1. **Binary Merge Limitations**: Logic Pro projects (.logicx bundles) are binary files that cannot be merged using traditional line-based diff/merge tools.

2. **Manual Reconciliation Process**: The current workflow (documented in `MERGE_PROTOCOL.md`) requires:
   - Exporting both versions to FCP XML manually
   - Using generic text diff tools (`diff`, Kaleidoscope, etc.)
   - Manually identifying and merging changes
   - Human judgment for conflict resolution
   - Re-importing the reconciled XML

3. **Pain Points**:
   - **Time-consuming**: Large projects with many tracks require extensive manual comparison
   - **Error-prone**: Easy to miss changes in verbose XML output
   - **No semantic understanding**: Generic diff tools show text differences, not musical/structural meaning
   - **Limited visualization**: Hard to understand the impact of changes
   - **No automation**: Every merge requires full manual intervention

### Impact

- **Collaboration bottleneck**: Teams avoid parallel work due to merge complexity
- **Reduced productivity**: Engineers spend hours manually comparing XML files
- **Merge avoidance**: Users prefer file locking over branching, limiting workflow flexibility
- **Quality risks**: Manual merges increase chance of data loss or incorrect reconciliation

---

## Proposed Solution

### Vision

An intelligent, automated FCP XML diff tool that:
- **Understands** the semantic structure of Logic Pro projects
- **Highlights** meaningful musical/production differences
- **Visualizes** changes in multiple formats (CLI, JSON, HTML)
- **Integrates** seamlessly with the existing OxVCS workflow
- **Accelerates** merge reconciliation by 80%+

### Key Features

#### Core Functionality
1. **Semantic XML Parsing**: Parse FCP XML with full understanding of Logic Pro structure
2. **Intelligent Diffing**: Compare projects at semantic level (tracks, regions, automation, plugins)
3. **Hierarchical Comparison**: Organize diffs by project structure (tracks → regions → clips)
4. **Change Categorization**: Classify changes (additions, deletions, modifications, conflicts)
5. **Multiple Output Formats**: Text summary, detailed JSON, interactive HTML report

#### Advanced Features (Future)
6. **Three-way merge support**: Compare base, branch A, branch B for true merge conflict detection
7. **Auto-merge suggestions**: Propose non-conflicting auto-merge operations
8. **Plugin state comparison**: Deep comparison of plugin parameters
9. **Automation curve diff**: Visual comparison of automation data
10. **Integration with OxVCS UI**: Native diff viewer in the macOS application

### Component Breakdown

#### 1. XML Parser (`fcpxml_parser`)
- Parse FCP XML files into structured Rust data types
- Handle multiple FCPXML versions (1.5-1.11)
- Validate XML structure
- Extract resources (media files, formats, effects)
- Build project hierarchy (sequences → tracks → clips → regions)

#### 2. Data Model (`fcpxml_model`)
Core types representing Logic Pro project structure:

```rust
pub struct Project {
    pub version: String,
    pub resources: Resources,
    pub sequences: Vec<Sequence>,
}

pub struct Resources {
    pub formats: Vec<Format>,
    pub media: Vec<Media>,
    pub effects: Vec<Effect>,
}

pub struct Sequence {
    pub name: String,
    pub duration: Rational,
    pub tracks: Vec<Track>,
}

pub struct Track {
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub track_type: TrackType, // Audio, MIDI, Video
    pub clips: Vec<Clip>,
    pub automation: Vec<AutomationCurve>,
}

pub struct Clip {
    pub name: String,
    pub start: Rational,
    pub duration: Rational,
    pub offset: Rational,
    pub media_ref: String,
}

pub struct AutomationCurve {
    pub parameter: String,
    pub points: Vec<AutomationPoint>,
}

pub enum TrackType {
    Audio,
    MIDI,
    Video,
}
```

#### 3. Diff Engine (`fcpxml_diff`)
Semantic comparison algorithms:

```rust
pub struct ProjectDiff {
    pub added_tracks: Vec<Track>,
    pub removed_tracks: Vec<Track>,
    pub modified_tracks: Vec<TrackDiff>,
    pub resource_changes: ResourceDiff,
}

pub struct TrackDiff {
    pub track_id: String,
    pub track_name: String,
    pub clip_changes: ClipDiff,
    pub automation_changes: AutomationDiff,
}

pub enum ChangeType {
    Added,
    Removed,
    Modified,
}
```

**Diff Algorithm**:
1. Parse both XML files into `Project` structs
2. Compare resources (media files, formats, effects)
3. Match tracks by ID/name (with fuzzy matching for renames)
4. For each track pair:
   - Compare clips (additions, deletions, moves, modifications)
   - Compare automation curves
   - Compare plugin chains
5. Identify conflicts (same element modified in both versions)
6. Generate structured diff report

#### 4. Output Formatter (`fcpxml_output`)
Multiple output formats:

```rust
pub trait OutputFormatter {
    fn format(&self, diff: &ProjectDiff) -> Result<String>;
}

pub struct TextFormatter;    // Human-readable terminal output
pub struct JsonFormatter;    // JSON for programmatic use
pub struct HtmlFormatter;    // Interactive HTML report
```

#### 5. CLI Interface (`fcpxml_diff_cli`)
Command-line tool:

```bash
# Basic diff
oxenvcs-fcpxml-diff base.xml feature.xml

# JSON output
oxenvcs-fcpxml-diff base.xml feature.xml --format json

# HTML report
oxenvcs-fcpxml-diff base.xml feature.xml --format html -o report.html

# Three-way merge
oxenvcs-fcpxml-diff --base original.xml --ours main.xml --theirs feature.xml

# Verbose output with all changes
oxenvcs-fcpxml-diff base.xml feature.xml --verbose

# Filter by track
oxenvcs-fcpxml-diff base.xml feature.xml --track "Vocal 1"
```

## Semantic Diff Algorithm Details

### Track Matching Strategy

1. **Exact ID Match**: Match tracks with identical IDs
2. **Name-based Match**: Match tracks with identical names
3. **Fuzzy Matching**: Use Levenshtein distance for renamed tracks (>80% similarity)
4. **Position-based Match**: Match by track order if name similarity is high
5. **Unmatched**: Report as added/removed

### Clip Comparison Algorithm

```
For each matched track pair:
  1. Build clip index by media reference and offset
  2. For each clip in base:
     a. Look for exact match (same media + offset)
     b. Look for moved clip (same media, different offset)
     c. Look for trimmed clip (same media, different duration)
     d. If not found, mark as removed
  3. For each clip in modified not matched:
     Mark as added
  4. For matched clips, compare properties:
     - Volume/gain
     - Fade in/out
     - Time stretch
     - Reverse playback
```

### Automation Diff Strategy

1. **Parameter Matching**: Match automation curves by parameter name
2. **Curve Comparison**:
   - Sample curves at fixed intervals (e.g., every 1/32 beat)
   - Compare values with tolerance (e.g., ±0.01 dB for volume)
   - Report significant deviations
3. **Simplification**: Ignore micro-changes below threshold (reduce noise)

### Conflict Detection (Three-way Merge)

```
For each element (track/clip/automation):
  base = element in base version
  ours = element in our branch
  theirs = element in their branch

  if base == ours && base != theirs:
    → Their change (auto-mergeable)
  elif base != ours && base == theirs:
    → Our change (auto-mergeable)
  elif base != ours && base != theirs && ours == theirs:
    → Same change on both sides (auto-mergeable)
  elif base != ours && base != theirs && ours != theirs:
    → **CONFLICT** - requires manual resolution
```

---

## Integration with Existing Workflow

### Updated Merge Protocol

**Current Workflow** (Manual):
1. Export both versions to FCP XML
2. Use generic diff tool (`diff`, Kaleidoscope)
3. Manually reconcile changes
4. Import back to Logic Pro

**Enhanced Workflow** (Semi-automated):
1. Export both versions to FCP XML (or auto-export via OxVCS)
2. **Run `oxenvcs-fcpxml-diff base.xml feature.xml --format html`**
3. **Review intelligent diff report with semantic changes highlighted**
4. **Use report to guide manual reconciliation** (80% faster)
5. Import reconciled XML back to Logic Pro

**Future Workflow** (Highly automated):
1. Merge conflict detected
2. **Auto-export both versions to FCP XML**
3. **Auto-run diff tool, identify conflicts**
4. **Present conflict resolution UI in OxVCS app**
5. **User resolves conflicts in-app** (select ours/theirs/manual)
6. **Auto-generate merged XML**
7. **Auto-import via Logic Pro scripting** (if possible)

### CLI Integration

Add new subcommand to `oxenvcs-cli`:

```bash
# Diff current version against another branch
oxenvcs-cli diff-xml main feature-vocals

# Diff two specific commits
oxenvcs-cli diff-xml --commit abc123 --commit def456

# Auto-export and diff
oxenvcs-cli diff-xml --auto-export main feature-vocals
```

### UI Integration

New "FCP XML Diff Viewer" window in OxVCS-App:
- **Left pane**: Track list with change indicators
- **Right pane**: Detailed changes for selected track
- **Bottom pane**: Conflict resolution controls
- **Toolbar**: Export report, refresh, filter options

## Performance Considerations

### Benchmarks & Targets

| Project Size | Tracks | Clips | Parse Time | Diff Time | Total Time |
|--------------|--------|-------|------------|-----------|------------|
| Small        | 5      | 20    | <100ms     | <50ms     | <150ms     |
| Medium       | 25     | 100   | <500ms     | <200ms    | <700ms     |
| Large        | 100    | 500   | <2s        | <1s       | <3s        |
| Very Large   | 250+   | 2000+ | <5s        | <3s       | <8s        |

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Streaming XML Parser**: Use `quick-xml` event-driven parsing (low memory)
2. **Parallel Processing**: Diff multiple sequences in parallel (Rayon)
3. **Indexing**: Build hash maps for O(1) track/clip lookups
4. **Lazy Evaluation**: Only compute detailed diffs when requested
5. **Caching**: Cache parsed XML structures between operations

---

## Limitations & Constraints

### Known Limitations

1. **FCP XML Coverage**: Not all Logic Pro features export to FCP XML
   - Flex Time/Pitch may not fully export
   - Drummer tracks have limited support
   - Some third-party plugins may lose state
   - Smart Controls mappings not preserved

2. **Diff Accuracy**: Semantic understanding has bounds
   - Plugin parameter names may not match across versions
   - Fuzzy matching may misidentify renames
   - Micro-timing differences may be noise or intentional

3. **Automation Complexity**: High-resolution automation curves are complex
   - Must balance precision vs. noise reduction
   - Visual diff of curves is challenging in text format

### Constraints

1. **Requires FCP XML Export**: Users must export from Logic Pro
   - Can be automated via AppleScript (future)
   - Adds extra step to workflow

2. **No Direct .logicx Parsing**: Cannot diff binary .logicx files directly
   - FCP XML is currently the only text-based interchange format
   - Future: Could explore reverse-engineering .logicx format (not recommended)

3. **macOS Only**: Logic Pro is macOS exclusive
   - Tool is macOS-focused but Rust code is cross-platform
   - Could theoretically work on other platforms for XML analysis only

## Conclusion

The Automated FCP XML Diff Tool will transform the Logic Pro merge workflow from a tedious, error-prone manual process into a fast, reliable, semi-automated operation. By providing semantic understanding of project structure, intelligent change detection, and multiple visualization options, this tool will:

- **Reduce merge time by 80%+**
- **Improve merge accuracy and reduce data loss**
- **Enable more effective collaboration workflows**
- **Integrate seamlessly with existing OxVCS tools**

The phased implementation approach ensures incremental value delivery, with a working CLI tool available in 6 weeks, full semantic diffing in 12 weeks, and complete UI integration in 26 weeks.

**Next Steps**:
1. Review and approve this implementation plan
2. Set up development environment and project structure
3. Begin Phase 1: Foundation (XML parser & basic diff)
4. Schedule weekly progress reviews
