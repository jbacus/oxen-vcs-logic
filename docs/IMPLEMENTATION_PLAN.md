- [x] Generate .oxenignore template with asset classification rules
- [x] Build Oxen initialization wrapper (`oxen.init()` + populate ignore file)

### 1.2 Basic Oxen Integration
- [x] Implement core operations module (init, add, commit, log, restore)
- [x] Add structured commit message format (BPM, sample rate, key signature)
- [x] Test with sample Logic Pro folder projects

### 1.3 Minimal FSEvents Monitor
- [x] Create standalone FSEvents listener in Swift
- [x] Implement basic debounce logic (30-60s inactivity threshold)
- [x] Test detection of projectData file changes

**Deliverable:** ‚úÖ Command-line tool (oxenvcs-cli) that can initialize, stage, and commit Logic Pro folder projects using Oxen.

---

## Phase 2: Service Architecture & Resilience ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Objective:** Build the production-grade macOS service layer.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed 2025-10-25

### 2.1 LaunchAgent Implementation
- [x] Create LaunchAgent plist configuration
- [x] Implement SMAppService registration
- [x] Build daemon with FSEvents monitoring and IPC listener

### 2.2 Power Management Integration
- [x] Register for system notifications (sleep/shutdown)
- [x] Implement emergency commit logic
- [x] Test with forced sleep/shutdown scenarios

### 2.3 Oxen CLI Wrapper Optimization
- [x] Build Rust FFI wrapper around liboxen
- [x] Package as embedded helper tool
- [x] Implement secure IPC (XPC)
- [x] Benchmark performance

### 2.4 Draft Tracking System
- [x] Create local "draft" branch on init
- [x] Implement auto-commit workflow
- [x] Add draft pruning logic
- [x] Test continuous editing sessions

**Deliverable:** ‚úÖ Background daemon (OxenDaemon) with automatic tracking and power-safe commits.

---

## Phase 3: UI Application & Collaboration ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Objective:** Complete user-facing application and team workflow features.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed 2025-10-25

### 3.1 Main UI Application
- [x] Repository browser view
- [x] Project initialization wizard
- [x] Milestone commit interface
- [x] Rollback/restore interface
- [x] Settings panel

### 3.2 Exclusive File Locking System
- [x] Design lock manifest schema
- [x] Implement lock acquisition/release
- [x] Enforce lock in LaunchAgent
- [x] Build admin force-break mechanism

### 3.3 Manual Merge Protocol
- [x] Document FCP XML reconciliation workflow
- [x] Add UI helpers for export/import
- [x] Test with divergent branches

### 3.4 Milestone Commit Pre-Flight
- [x] Implement cleanup automation
- [x] Add confirmation dialog
- [x] Execute staging ‚Üí commit ‚Üí push sequence

**Deliverable:** ‚úÖ Complete macOS application (OxVCS-App) with collaboration features.

## Testing Strategy

**Implemented Testing Approach:**
- ‚úÖ Unit tests for all core functions
- ‚úÖ Integration tests for FSEvents ‚Üí commit pipeline
- ‚úÖ LockManager comprehensive test suite (90%+ coverage)
- ‚úÖ Manual testing with real Logic Pro projects
- ‚è≥ System tests with 8+ hour sessions (ongoing)
- ‚è≥ Performance benchmarks for large projects (50+ GB) (planned)

See [TESTING_STRATEGY.md](TESTING_STRATEGY.md) and [TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for comprehensive testing approach.

---

## Critical Path Items ‚úÖ COMPLETE

1. ‚úÖ Prove Oxen performance with real Logic Pro project
2. ‚úÖ Validate FSEvents debounce accuracy
3. ‚úÖ Test power event handling thoroughly
4. ‚úÖ Implement locking before multi-user testing

All critical path items successfully completed.

## Documentation Update (2025-10-27)

### Comprehensive Documentation Overhaul

Following successful completion of all three phases, comprehensive documentation was created/updated:

**Component READMEs:**
- OxVCS-CLI-Wrapper/README.md: 62 ‚Üí 435 lines (architecture, features, usage, testing)
- OxVCS-LaunchAgent/README.md: 49 ‚Üí 558 lines (daemon details, XPC API, configuration)
- OxVCS-App/README.md: 47 ‚Üí 637 lines (UI features, MVVM architecture, user guide)

**Project Documentation:**
- README.md: Updated to show all phases complete
